============================================================

.. The large version wont work because github strips rst image rescaling.

This repository addresses the algorithmic challenges of the
`IARPA SMART <https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/smart>`_ (Space-based
Machine Automated Recognition Technique) program.  The goal of this software is
analyze space-based imagery to perform broad-area search for natural and
anthropogenic events and characterize their extent and progression in time and
space.

Getting Started
---------------

To quickly get started locally, clone the geowatch repo:


.. code:: bash

   # Create a directory for CODE
   mkdir -p $HOME/code
   # Internal
   # git clone https://gitlab.kitware.com/smart/watch/  $HOME/code/watch

   # Public
   git clone https://gitlab.kitware.com/computer-vision/geowatch/  $HOME/code/watch


Then run:

.. code:: bash

   cd $HOME/code/watch
   bash ./run_developer_setup.sh


Test everything is working by running

.. code:: bash

   ./run_tests.py

For more details see the `installing GEOWATCH for development guide <docs/environment/installing_watch.rst>`_.

The GEOWATCH CLI
----------------

The ``geowatch`` module comes with a set of command line tools.
Using ``python -m geowatch --help`` or ``geowatch --help`` shows the top level modal CLI:

.. code::

    usage: geowatch [-h] [--version]
                    {add_fields,align,stats,reproject,visualize,spectra,dvcdir,run_tracker,iarpa_eval,model_stats,clean_geotiffs,animate,average_features,time_combine,crop_sitemodels,remove_bad_images,schedule,manager,aggregate}
                    ...

As a researcher / developer / user the most important commands for you to know are:

* ``geowatch stats <kwcoco_file>`` - Get geowatch-relevant statistics about data in a kwcoco file

* ``geowatch visualize <kwcoco_file>`` - Visualize the image / videos / annotations in a kwcoco file.

* ``geowatch spectra <kwcoco_file>`` - Look at the distribution of intensity values per band / per sensor in a kwcoco file.

* ``geowatch model_stats <fusion_model_file>`` - Get stats / info about a trained fusion model.

* ``geowatch reproject`` - Reproject CRS84 (geojson) annoations to image space and write to a kwcoco file.

* ``geowatch align`` - Crop a kwcoco dataset based on CRS84 (geojson) regions.

* ``geowatch clean_geotiff`` - Heuristic to detect large regions of black pixels and edit them to NODATA in the geotiff.

* ``geowatch geotiffs_to_kwcoco`` - Create a kwcoco file from a set of on-disk geotiffs.

* ``smartwatch_dvc`` - Helper to register / retreive your DVC paths so scripts can be written agnostic to filesystem layouts. See `docs <docs/data/using_smartwatch_dvc.rst>`_ for more details.
