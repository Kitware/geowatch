GEOWATCH TPL
============

A package that holds third-party libraries that some geowatch tasks require.
This package is installed with geowatch itself. Simply running:

.. code:: python

   import geowatch_tpl


Will make all of the submodules in this repo available.

Note: in the future, we may be more explicit about which third party modules
are included in the sys.path munging.
