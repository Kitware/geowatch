This is a companion script to ./feature_fusion_tutorial.sh which walks through
the steps of computing your features, training a fusion model, and comparing it
to a baseline result.

In contrast this script simply illustrates how to reproduce the baseline
result.

This tutorial assumes you have:

    1. Setup the project DVC repo

    2. Have registered the location of your DVC repo with geowatch_dvc.  
    
    3. Have pulled the appropriate dataset (in this case Drop4)
       and have unzipped the annotations.

    3. Have the IARPA metrics code installed:

        # Clone this repo and pip install it to your watch environment
        https://gitlab.kitware.com/smart/metrics-and-test-framework


This tutorial will cover:

    1. Running the evaluation script on a single model.

# Determine the paths to your SMART data and experiment repositories.
DATA_DVC_DPATH=$(geowatch_dvc --tags='phase2_data' --hardware=auto)
EXPT_DVC_DPATH=$(geowatch_dvc --tags='phase2_expt' --hardware=auto)


echo "
EXPT_DVC_DPATH=$EXPT_DVC_DPATH
DATA_DVC_DPATH=$DATA_DVC_DPATH
"


# The baseline model is checked into the experiment DVC repo.  This is the
# model we used in the November delievery. You may need to pull it from DVC if
# you haven't already.

# NOTE:
# the feature_fusion_tutorial curently just runs the baseline on
# ``data_vali.kwcoco.json`` but here we run that file through ``split_videos``
# first which breaks it up into a kwcoco file per region. We then run the
# evaluation on each region separately. We will likely want to adopt this
# strategy for running evaluations so we can compare results at a more 
# granular level.

# The BAS-only evalution pipeline can be executed as follows.  The
# ``--root_dpath`` specifies where the output will be written.


# NOTE: In this exmaple we have commented out KR_R002 and US_R007 to allow for
# getting the results of the pipeline fairly quickly (~15 minutes).

### NOTE:
# The above script assumes that your bashrc activates the appropriate
# virtualenv by default. If this is not the case you will need to specify an
# additional argument to `watch.mlops.schedule_evaluation`. Namely:
# ``--virtualenv_cmd``. For instance if you have a conda environment named
# "watch", you would add ``--virtualenv_cmd="watch"`` to the command.

__evaldoc__='
To inspect the results nativate to ``$EXPT_DVC_DPATH/_evaluations`` In there
there will be a folder "eval/flat/base_poly_eval". This corresponds to the "BAS
Polygon Evaluation Node" in the BAS Pipeline.  Inside that folder there will be
another folder with the same name and a hash suffix. This represents a specific
node configuration.  When I ran this I got: `bas_poly_eval_id_ace8cc06`.  Path
differences on different machines may cause this hash to be different.

Inside this folder is

    * invoke.sh - a script to reproduce the run of that specific node
    * job_config.json - the configuration of this node at the pipeline level
    * summary.csv - a high level summary of the T&E Results for this run.
    * poly_eval.json - a summarized run of high level T&E scores as well as a compute history.

There will also be a folder for each region (in this case just KR_R001)
containing detailed T&E evaluation outputs and visualizations.


In poly_eval.json running:

    jq ".best_bas_rows.data[0]" poly_eval.json

Should result in scores simlar to:
