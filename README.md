# SMART WATCH

This repository addresses the algorithmic challenges of the IARPA SMART program. The goal of this software is analyze space-based imagery to perform broad-area search for natural and anthropogenic events and characterize their extent and progression in time and space.

### Getting Started

#### Create Conda environment

The first step in running or developing WATCH code is to obtain the
correct development environment.  The WATCH algorithms require a number of
dependencies on geospatial and computer vision libraries.  Provided with this
repository are instructions for configuring a development environment with
Conda.  Conda provides a consistent development environment with a known
configuration of dependencies versions.  Follow the directions in
[deployment/conda/README.rd](./deployment/conda/README.md) to setup this environment.
